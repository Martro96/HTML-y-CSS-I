                    With over 5 years of experience in design and photography, my passion is driven by creating new landscapes, with a computer, a pencil or a camera. 
                </p>    
                <p>
                    I started with photography, defined myself with graphic design, matured with UX design, and now I enjoy helping other people achieve their goals.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As a designer, I love embarking on new projects and putting all my creativity, knowledge, and work into creating a more inclusive, accessible, and creative digital world.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As a Mentor, my goal is to provide my students with an enriching experience that takes them to the next level of their professional career.
